# Automatic-Verb-Classifier-for-Abui-AVC-abz-
This repository contains the R code used in the Automatic Verb Classifier for Abui. 
It is a clustering tool allowing to explore the verbal inflectional classes in Abui (Glottolog code: abui1241; Glottolog profile: https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/abui1241). The system uses a manually created learning set with inflectional profiles Abui verbs as data for a k-means clustering algorithm. The clustering is subsequently compared with the corpus data, harvested using the Matrix ODIN Morphology (MOM) tool, as described in Zamaraeva et al. 2017. 

The implemented system is available at: http://gogo.utia.cas.cz/abui/.
